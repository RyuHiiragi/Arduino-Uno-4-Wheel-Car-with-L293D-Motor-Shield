# Arduino-Uno-4-Wheel-Car-with-L293D-Motor-Shield
This project is aimed at building a remote-controlled car using an Arduino Uno, a L293D motor shield, and 4 DC motorsâ€”one for each wheel. The objective is to create a simple yet effective robotic platform that provides hands-on experience with motor control, serial communication, and embedded programming using the Arduino ecosystem.
